## Project Overview

The project aims to automate the process of fetching cryptocurrency data from a website's API using Python. It demonstrates how to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize the data. This can be useful for keeping track of cryptocurrency trends over time.

## Data Extraction

Data is extracted from the website's API, which provides information about various cryptocurrencies. The data includes details such as coin ID, name, symbol, price, and timestamp.

## Data Cleaning

The extracted data may need cleaning to remove unnecessary columns or fix formatting issues. Data cleaning ensures that the data is in a usable format for analysis and visualization.

## Data Analysis

The project demonstrates basic data analysis techniques to extract insights from the cryptocurrency data. For example, it calculates mean percent changes in coin prices over various time intervals.

## Data Visualization

Data visualizations are created to represent cryptocurrency trends. Visualizations include line plots and point plots to illustrate the price changes of specific coins over time.
